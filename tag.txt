Here are the steps for implementing the feature to tag other users in posts and comments:

1. Update the database schema: Add a new field to the post and comment schema to store the list of tagged users. This field can be an array of user IDs.
2. Implement the API endpoint: Create an API endpoint that accepts the post or comment ID and the list of tagged user IDs as parameters. The endpoint should update the post or comment with the new list of tagged users.
3. Update the UI: Add a tagging feature to the post and comment form in the UI. This can be done using a library like [**React-Tag-Input**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tag-input).
4. Implement the user lookup feature: When the user starts typing the name of another user, the app should search the database for users whose name matches the input and display a list of suggestions. This can be done using an API endpoint that accepts the search query as a parameter and returns a list of matching users.
5. Implement the notification feature: When a user is tagged in a post or comment, the app should send a notification to that user. This can be done using a library like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Pusher.
